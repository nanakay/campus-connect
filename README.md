# Rails development with Yaw Boakye 

With me in the class are Eric Engmann and Adelaide Atakora

As part of the learning process, each of us is supposed to build a project for an idea of 
his/her choice. I'm working on campusConnect.

This is a platform that brings students on campuses together to share ideas, resources, have discussion, form
study groups, have chat session, etc.
